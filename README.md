# CTO / System Architect — Crypto & FinTech

I work on financial and crypto systems where failures have real consequences.

Over 15+ years, my work has focused on:
- trading and financial infrastructure
- blockchain protocols and token models
- systems that handle money, risk, and irreversible operations
- explicit rules and invariants instead of ad-hoc business logic

In recent roles, I worked with small engineering teams while retaining primary technical ownership.
My responsibilities included system design, key implementation decisions, and production behavior.

## Selected Products (Live Systems)

### dxs.app  
https://dxs.app

Crypto trading system.

- Designed and implemented the core system architecture  
- Session-based accounting with explicit risk isolation  
- Technical owner responsible for system behavior in production

---

### fiorin.app  
https://fiorin.app

Self-custodial crypto wallet.

- Designed and implemented client-side custody and transaction flow  
- Clear separation between key management, signing, and execution  

## Selected Work

- **[dxs-stas-sdk](https://github.com/dxsapp/dxs-stas-sdk)**  
  TypeScript SDK for building and reading Bitcoin SV transactions, with first-class support for STAS token scripts.

- **[dxs-consigliere](https://github.com/dxsapp/dxs-consigliere)**  
  The DXS-built BSV STAS indexer with Back-to-Genesis resolution, powered by RavenDB and real-time SignalR updates.

I’m open to CTO or principal architect roles in early-stage crypto / fintech teams
where system design and risk modeling are taken seriously.
