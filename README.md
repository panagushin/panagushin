# CTO / System Architect — Crypto & FinTech

CTO-level engineer with 15+ years of experience designing and owning high-risk financial and crypto systems.

My work focuses on:
- trading and financial infrastructure
- blockchain protocols and token models
- system architectures with strict correctness and bounded risk
- protocol-level guarantees over ad-hoc business logic

In recent roles, I operated as a solo technical owner, covering the full CTO scope:
from system and economic design to implementation and production readiness.
I actively use AI tooling to replace and outperform traditional development teams up to senior level.

## Selected Work

- **[dxs-stas-sdk](https://github.com/dxsapp/dxs-stas-sdk)**
  Blockchain token infrastructure SDK with a focus on correctness, transfer invariants,
  and protocol-level guarantees.

- **[dxs-consigliere](https://github.com/dxsapp/dxs-consigliere)**  
  System-level decision and constraint framework designed for deterministic,
  correctness-first financial logic.

I’m open to CTO or principal architect roles in early-stage crypto / fintech teams,
where architectural quality and risk discipline are critical.
