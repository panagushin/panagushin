# CTO / System Architect — Crypto & FinTech

I design and own financial and crypto systems where failures have real consequences.

Over 15+ years, my work has focused on:
- trading and financial infrastructure
- blockchain protocols and token models
- systems that handle money, risk, and irreversible operations
- explicit rules and invariants instead of ad-hoc business logic

In recent roles, I worked as a solo technical owner, covering the full CTO scope —
from system and economic design to implementation and production readiness.
I rely on strong architecture, tooling, and automation rather than large engineering teams.

## Selected Work

- **[dxs-stas-sdk](https://github.com/dxsapp/dxs-stas-sdk)**  
  Blockchain token infrastructure SDK focused on transfer invariants
  and protocol-level guarantees.

- **[dxs-consigliere](https://github.com/dxsapp/dxs-consigliere)**  
  Decision and constraint framework for deterministic,
  correctness-first financial systems.

I’m open to CTO or principal architect roles in early-stage crypto / fintech teams
where system design and risk modeling are taken seriously.
